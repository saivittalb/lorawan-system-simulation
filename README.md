The Golay Code error correction scheme for Low Power Low Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) was described. GFSK modulation (and demodulation) scheme was implemented in an AWGN channel. Encoding and decoding this model using the binary Golay Codes was done which gives a lower BER. The BER curves have been plotted for varying Signal-to-Noise ratios (SNR). Additionally, the OFDMA transmission technique was also implemented.

Tools utilized - MATLAB, VHDL.

Developed as a part of EE 307 - Communication Theory II course project. Details and specifications can be viewed in a report titled as ```Final-Report.docx```.
